# Clustering
A Jupyter Notebook for a data mining project focused on preprocessing and analyzing a dataset of people who have heart failure. The project includes handling outliers, clustering, and classifying the individuals based on various health metrics.
# Algorithms Used
Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: For detecting and handling outliers in numerical data.
Fuzzy C-Means Clustering: For clustering analysis, including:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): For reducing dimensionality for easier visualization.
Silhouette Score: For determining the optimal number of clusters.
Calinski-Harabasz Index: For evaluating clustering performance.
Davies-Bouldin Index: For evaluating clustering performance.
K-Medoids Clustering: For robust clustering, less sensitive to outliers compared to k-means.
Hierarchical Clustering: For hierarchical data structure analysis and dendrogram visualization.
